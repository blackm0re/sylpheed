What's Sylpheed
===============

Sylpheed is an e-mail client based on GTK+ GUI toolkit.
Sylpheed runs on Unix-like systems such as Linux, BSD and Mac OS X, or
Microsoft Windows (XP or later).

Sylpheed is a free software distributed under the GNU GPL (the library part
LibSylph is GNU LGPL).

Sylpheed has the following features:

    * Simple, beautiful, and well-polished user interface
    * Comfortable operationality which is built in detail
    * Well-organized, easy-to-understand configuration
    * Lightweight operation
    * High reliability
    * Internationalization and Multilingualization support
    * High-level Japanese processing
    * Various protocols support
    * Multi-thread support
    * Security feature (GnuPG, SSL/TLSv1)
    * Powerful filtering and search
    * Junk mail control
    * Flexible cooperation with external commands
    * Plug-in faculty

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
Windows, such as Outlook or Becky!. Many commands are accessible with
the keyboard like the Emacs-based mailers such as Mew and Wanderlust.
So you will be able to migrate to Sylpheed without much discomfort, even if
you are accustomed to other mailers.

The messages are managed by MH format, and you will be able to use it together
with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). It has less possibility
of losing mails on failures since one file corresponds to one mail. You can
import or export mbox and eml format messages. You can also utilize fetchmail
and/or procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or imget).

Installation
============

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Usage
=====

Preparation before running
--------------------------

If you are using a character encoding other than UTF-8 for filename,
you must set the following environmental variable (it will not work if
it is not specified):

(use locale-specific encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@locale

or

(manually specifying encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1

If you want to display messages translated to your language,
you must specify some environmental variables related to locale.
For example:

% export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8

(replace de_DE.UTF-8 to the actual locale name)

If you don't want translated messages, set LC_MESSAGES to "C"
(and unset LC_ALL if specified).

How to run
----------

Input `sylpheed' on a command line, or double-click the icon in a file
manager to execute.

Initial startup
---------------

When Sylpheed is executed for the first time, it automatically creates the
configuration files under ~/.sylpheed-2.0/, and asks you the location of
mailbox. The default is ~/Mail. If some files, which are non-MH format,
already exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.

If ~/.sylpheed-2.0/ doesn't exist, but the previous version of configuration
exists in ~/.sylpheed/, migration will be made automatically after the
confirmation.

If the locale encoding is not UTF-8 and the environmental variable
G_FILENAME_ENCODING is not set, an alert dialog will be displayed.

Required settings
-----------------

Initially, you have to create at least one account to send or receive
messages (you can read messages that already exist without creating
accounts). The configuration dialog will be shown by clicking
"Configuration -> Create new account..." in the menu, or "Account" on
the toolbar. Then, fill the required settings.

Refer to the manual supplied with this program for the general usage.

Hidden settings
---------------

You can configure most of the features in Sylpheed through the preferences
dialog, but there are a few parameters which don't have user interface
(you don't need to modify them in normal use). You must edit
~/.sylpheed-2.0/sylpheedrc by an editor while Sylpheed is not running.

allow_jisx0201_kana		allow JIS X 0201 Kana (half-width kana) on
				sending
				0: off  1: on   [default: 0]
translate_header		translate headers such as 'From:', 'To:' and
				'Subject:'
				0: off  1: on   [default: 1]
enable_rules_hint		enable alternating row colors for summary view
				0: off  1: on   [default: 1]
bold_unread			show unread messages using bold font in
				summary view
				0: off  1: on   [default: 1]
textview_cursor_visible		show cursor in the text view
				0: off  1: on   [default: 0]
mime_image_viewer		specify the command to open attached image
				files [default: none]
mime_audio_player		specify the command to open attached audio
				files [default: none]
mime_command			specify the command to open MIME attachments
				[default: none]
logwindow_line_limit		specify the limit of line numbers of log
				window
				0: unlimited  n (> 0): n lines [default: 1000]
mark_as_read_on_new_window	only mark messages as read when they are
				opened with new window
				0: off  1: on   [default: 0]

Unlike 1.0.x, this version doesn't allow direct modification of the menu
shortcuts by default. You can use the following methods to configure them:

1. Using GNOME 2.8 or later
   Run gconf-editor from 'Applications - System Tools - Configuration Editor'.
   Select 'desktop - gnome - interface' and check 'can-change-accels' in it.

2. Using GNOME before 2.8, or other environments
   Add gtk-can-change-accels = 1 to the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 (or create a new
   one, if it doesn't exist).

3. When Sylpheed is not running, directly edit ~/.sylpheed-2.0/menurc with
   an editor.
