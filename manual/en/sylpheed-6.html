into an e-mail and send it to the developer or the mailing list.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Configuration menu</A>
</H2>

<P>In the Configuration menu, clearly, you can set up Sylpheed 
the way you want it to work and react.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Common preferences:</I> in this option you will be 
presented a dialog in which you can select a number 
of tabs. Each tab represents a specific set of settings 
in Sylpheed. In the next chapter, these dialog options 
are explained in more detail.</LI>
<LI><I>Filter setting:</I> this option shows you a dialog in which you 
can set up the filtering rules that you want Sylpheed 
to process on receiving new e-mails. You first specify 
on which part(s) of the e-mail Sylpheed has to check, 
and then you tell Sylpheed what to do. You can move the 
message to a different directory (including trash to get 
rid of spam mail). Selecting the destination folder is 
possible through a browser window that comes up when you 
press "Select..."
<P>You can choose not to receive the e-mail. Note that 
this will leave the message on the mailserver of your 
provider, the message will not be removed!
<P>When you press the "Register" button, the filter 
rule is added to the list of rules. Do you select 
"Substitute", then the selected rule is replaced by the 
information of the setting entered. "Delete" in the end 
will delete the selected filtering rule.
<P>Please note that you can set up two selections for a rule, 
which can be "OR'd" or "AND'd". OR means that one of the 
two selections will have to match for the rule to be 
executed. AND means that both selections have to match 
before an action is performed.
<P>To the right of the selection rules you see buttons 
called UP and DOWN. You can move rules up and down in 
the list. This will often trigger different behaviour 
in the selections, so consider the order in which 
you set the rules.
</LI>
<LI><I>Template:</I> let your create a new message template.
When composing a new message you can then used one
of the defined templates and insert it (or use it to
completely replace the content of your mail).

that are replaced when the template is used in order
to create a dynamic text. Use the symbols button on
the templates definition window to see the list of
the available symbols.</LI>
<LI><I>Actions:</I> let your create new commands to be added to the
'Tools/Actions' menu. An action is a command that processes
the select part of a message, the message body or the complete
message file. It can be a background process, used as a filter
(reads, modifies and replaces a message),...</LI>
<LI><I>Preferences for current account:</I> here you can set the 
specifics for the account you are currently using. 
Should mail be deleted after fetching, what is the 
server it comes from, etc. Basically it is the same 
dialog form as shown in setting up a new account.</LI>
<LI><I>Create new account:</I> here you name the account (each 
account has a recognizable name), you set up your name 
and e-mail address etc. You set up the type of server 
you access (POP4, IMAP4, local mailbox, newsserver) 
and where the downloaded messages have to go (default 
folder is the inbox). In the RECEIVE tab you select or 
unselect options, in SEND you can set up how to send 
your messages. In COMPOSE you can point to a specific 
signature file, and in ADVANCED you can set up alternate 
ports for the server, if these exist. (Do not mess 
with these unless you are sure you have to!!)</LI>
<LI><I>Edit accounts:</I> here you can select one of the accounts 
you created, from a list, and edit the information about 
them. Note that you cannot edit an account for which 
you are writing a message at the same time. This to 
ensure data integrity.</LI>
<LI><I>Change current account:</I> here you can select what 
account you want to use, to write a message.
If you have enabled the status bar (in the view menu),
the name of the current account is shown in the bottom
right corner of the Sylpheed window (in the status bar)
and can be changed by a click on it (then a menu appears
and lists all your accounts).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 Help menu</A>
</H2>

<P>This menu lets you look at the manual and FAQ of Sylpheed, 
and you can also see the "about" info, who wrote Sylpheed.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 Context menu</A>
</H2>

<P>You can pull up context menus (through clicking button2) for 
the folder tree and the summary pane. (windows users: button2 
is the right mouse button.)
<P>In the folder view you can add, rename and remove folders 
through the context menu. You can also set the folder
properties (define the selected folder as an inbox, outbox,
trash, ...).
<P>In the message summary you can do a host of things from the 
context menu, like viewing message headers, opening a message 
in a separate window (also possible by double clicking on a 
message) etc...
